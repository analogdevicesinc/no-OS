// This file contains the list of suppressions used by the cppcheck tool
//
// The surpression format:
// [error id]:[filename]
// 
// Example where all the warnings under the "drivers" folder are suppressed:
// *:drivers/*
// 
// Please use ".cppcheckignore" only for files/folders that are included
// as libraries/modules and are outside of the scope of this repository. 
//
// Another alternative is using inline suppressions. Please see Cppcheck manual
// for further information: https://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/manual.pdf
