no-OS's documentation
*********************

The **no-OS** project has been started as a result of customers’ need to
configure ADI’s hardware components from bare-metal software environments.
Even if the initial request was for software drivers, no-OS has evolved to an
entire framework able to generate complete applications, highly customizable
according to users’ requirements.

.. note::

   We are in the process of moving the no-OS documentation from `wiki.analog.com <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/no-os>`_
   to  `github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_.
   
   We apologize for any inconvenience that may occur due to this migration.
