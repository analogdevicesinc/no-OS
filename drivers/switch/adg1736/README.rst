ADG1736 no-OS driver
====================

Supported Devices
-----------------

- `ADG1736 <https://www.analog.com/en/products/adg1736.html>`_

Overview
--------

The ADG1736 is a monolithic device comprising two independently selectable
CMOS single pole, double throw (SPDT) switches. Each switch can connect
its input to one of two outputs (A or B) based on the control signal.

The device operates from 1.8 V to 5.5 V single supply and features:
- Low on resistance (2.5 Î© typical)
- Fast switching times (tON: 16 ns, tOFF: 8 ns)
- Break-before-make switching action
- TTL-/CMOS-compatible control inputs

Applications
------------

- Audio and video switching
- USB 1.1 signal switching
- Sample-and-hold systems
- Communications systems
- Mechanical reed relay replacement

ADG1736 Device Configuration
----------------------------

Driver Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be able to use the device, you will have to provide the support
for the communication protocol (GPIO for the control pins IN1 and IN2).

The first API to be called is **adg1736_init**. Make sure that it returns 0,
which means that the driver was initialized correctly.

Switch Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use **adg1736_set_switch_state()** to control which output each switch connects to:
- ADG1736_CONNECT_A: Connect to output A (IN = HIGH)
- ADG1736_CONNECT_B: Connect to output B (IN = LOW)

Use **adg1736_get_switch_state()** to read the current switch position.

                        .number = 1,
                        .platform_ops = &gpio_platform_ops,
                        .extra = NULL,
                },

                },
        };

        ret = adg1736_init(&adg1736_device, &adg1736_init_param);
        if (ret != 0)
                return ret;

        // Set switch 1 to connect to output A
        ret = adg1736_set_switch_state(adg1736_device, ADG1736_SW1, ADG1736_CONNECT_A);
        if (ret != 0)
                return ret;

        // Set switch 2 to connect to output B  
        ret = adg1736_set_switch_state(adg1736_device, ADG1736_SW2, ADG1736_CONNECT_B);
        if (ret != 0)
                return ret;
