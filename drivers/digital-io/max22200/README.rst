`MAX22200 <https://www.analog.com/MAX22200>`

Overview
--------

The MAX22200 is an octal 36V serial-controlled solenoid driver.
Each channel features a low impedance (200mÎ© typ) push-pull output stage with 
sink-and-source driving capability and up to 1ARMS driving current. 
A serial interface (SPI) that also supports daisy-chain configurations is 
provided to individually control each channel.

Applications
------------

* Relays Driver
* Solenoid, Valves, Electromagnetic Drivers
* Generic Low-Side and High-Side Switch Applications
* Latched (Bi-Stable) Solenoid Valve Drivers
* Brushed DC Motor Driver

MAX22200 Device Configuration
-----------------------------

In order to use the MAX22200, you will have to provide support for the
communication protocol (SPI), but also a GPIO for the CMD pin since before every
SPI transaction  there needs to be a SPI write to the Command Register while
CMD pin is logic high, and then performing the actual SPI transaction with CMD
pin logic low.
Also the ENABLE pin needs to be logic high for the device to be able to be
initialized.

The first API to be called is **max22200_init**. Make sure that it returns 0,
which means that the driver was initialized correctly.

Chopping frequency can also be changed with **max22200_set_chop_freq**.

External trigger configuration
------------------------------

An external trigger can be assigned to the TRIG pin, but in order for that to
work a GPIO initalization parameter for the trig pin needs to be set so the GPIO
is initialized and controlled by the master.
This can be used in both Half and Full Bridge modes for applications like
DC motor drivers.

The state of the trigger can be change with the help of
**max22200_set_trig_state** API.

Channel configuration
---------------------

Each channel can be configured in a lot of ways, but the first one of all is
the **max22200_set_ch_state** which is to be called by the user after the
initialization is performed correctly in order to activate a specific channel.

After that the channel's configuration can be changed on-the-fly.

HIT time and current can be changed with **max22200_set_ch_hit**.
HOLD current can be changed with **max222000_set_ch_hold**.

Scale can be set for a channel with **max22200_set_ch_scale** which for
half the fullscale will double the resistor and the current will be reduced
to half.

Channel trigger can be changed to be either controlled by the SPI interface
or the external trigger with **max22200_set_ch_trig**.

Channel mode and frequency can also be set with the help of
**max22200_set_ch_mode** and **max22200_set_ch_freq**.

And at last for every channel there are some specific enables that the user
can enable/disable with the help of **max22200_set_ch_enable**.

For every API to set a channel configuration in the CFG CH register there is
also a API to get a channel configuration form the CFG CH register.

Fault mask configuration
------------------------

Fault masks can be set for the whole device in the STATUS register with the
help of **max22200_fault_mask_set**, and read with **max22200_fault_mask_get**.

DPM configuration
-----------------

Detection of plunger movement can be configured as well with the help of the
**max22200_set_cfg_dpm** where the user can set specific values for the DPM.
The same specific values can be read with the help of **max22200_get_cfg_dpm**.
