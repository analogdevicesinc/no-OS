	  Enable support for platform-specific drivers.

	  This section contains low-level platform drivers for various
	  microcontrollers and processors including STM32, Maxim, and
	  other hardware platforms. These drivers provide hardware
	  abstraction for peripherals like GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, etc.

	help
	  Enable the CAPI-based I2C bitbang driver that uses CAPI GPIO.

	  This driver provides software I2C functionality using GPIO pins
	  controlled through the CAPI GPIO interface. It supports standard
	  I2C features including clock stretching, configurable speed, and
	  both open-drain and push-pull modes.
