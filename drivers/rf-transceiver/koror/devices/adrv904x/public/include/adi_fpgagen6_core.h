/**
* \brief    The Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) allows the dynamic change of parameters of the
*           GTY primitives. The DRP interface is used primarily to configure PHY modules, including
*           QPLL and channel configuration. Please refer to Xilinx User Guide 578 for a complete
*           register map.
* 
*           To read a particular register through the DRP interface you must supply three items:
*               
*               1.  The module of interest, provided through the drp parameter. Examples include
*                   the PHY channels and the QPLLs. Please refer to adi_fpgagen6_DrpInterface_e
*                   for valid interfaces; all others will return ADI_FPGAGEN6_ERR_ACT_CHECK_PARAM
*               2.  The address, provided through the addr parameter. 
*               3.  The bits of interest, provided through the rdMask parameter. 
*               
*                   Note: As a convenience, the API will shift the register value readback so 
*                   that the bits of interest are in LSB position.
*                   Example, if rdMask = 0x70, the API will shift the register value >> 4 and
*                   return the shifted value in rdMask.
*                   This is different than adi_fpgagen6_DrpWrite in that the provided wrWord must
*                   already be shifted.
*                   
*           The adi_fpgagen6_DrpAddress_e and adi_fpgagen6_DrpMask_e can be used together, for
*           the addr and wrMask parameters respectively, to access configuration parameters that 
*           the API programs during initialization, however the API will not perform error checking 
*           on these two parameter so any combination can be provided.
*           
*           The addr and wrMask parameters are defined in the Xilix User Guide 578 Appendix C as
*           DRP Address and DRP Bits, respectively.
