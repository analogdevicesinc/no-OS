choice BLE_MODE
	prompt "BLE Operation Mode"
	default BLE_MODE_PERIPHERAL
	help
	  Select the Bluetooth Low Energy operation mode for the FTC Workshop project.

config BLE_MODE_PERIPHERAL
	bool "Peripheral Mode"
	help
	  Run as a BLE peripheral device that advertises and accepts connections.
	  This mode implements a full BLE stack with GATT services and can be
	  discovered and connected to by central devices.

config BLE_MODE_HCI_UART
	bool "HCI-UART Mode"
	help
	  Run as an HCI controller accessible via UART interface.
	  This mode exposes the Bluetooth controller through HCI commands over UART,
	  allowing external host applications to control the BLE functionality.
	  Useful for sending custom BLE data and implementing host applications.
