Please see: https://wiki.analog.com/resources/no-os/build

No-OS Supported Examples
------------------------

The initialization data used in the examples is taken out from:
`Project Common Data Path <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS/tree/main/projects/ltc4296/src/common>`_

The macros used in Common Data are defined in platform specific files found in:
`Project Platform Configuration Path <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS/tree/main/projects/ltc4296/src/platform>`_

Basic example
